Since the “ORENIST.data” file is for Python2.7, 
it is necessary to convert it to a data file for Python3.6 using “ORENIST-conv-to-python3.py” (Python2.7).
The conversion operation is influenced by environmental factors, 
so trial and error are required.
"ORENIST-conv-to-python3.py" (Python2.7) is converted to a binary data file as "ORENIST3p2b.data" on Windows 10, 
and its operation has been confirmed.
